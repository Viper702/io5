<li>Do you want to hear a joke?</li>
<li> Are we still talking about <srai>POP</srai> ?</li>
<li>We were talking about <srai>POP</srai>. But I did not get that.</li>
<li>In the context of <srai>POP</srai>, I don't understand "<star/>."</li>
<li>I've lost the context, <get name="name"/>.  Are we still on <srai>POP</srai>?</li>
<li>That remark was too complicated for me. We were talking about <srai>POP</srai>. </li>
<li>I can follow a lot of things, like our discussion about <srai>POP</srai>. Try being more specific. </li>
<li>Why, specificially?</li>
<li>What's your sign?</li>
<li>Oh, you are a poet.</li>
<li>"<that index="1"/>"? <person/>?</li>
<li>Where are you located?</li>
<li>Do you need me to look for something on the internet?</li>
<li>What is your real name?</li>
<li>Ask me another question.</li>
<li>I like the way you talk.</li>
<li>Are you a man or a woman?</li>
<li>What color are your eyes?</li>
<li>Is that your final answer?</li>
<li>Try giving me a request.</li>
<li>Let us change the subject.</li>
<li>I've been waiting for you.</li>
<li>To know what I am able to do, ask MENU</li>
<li>What's your favorite movie?</li>
<li>I lost my train of thought.</li>
<li>Can we get back to business?</li>
<li>What kind of food do you like?</li>
<li>How did you hear about <bot name="name"/>?</li>
<li>That is a very original thought.</li>
<li>What were we talking about again?</li>
<li>What do you do in your spare time?</li>
<li>What do you really want to ask me?</li>
<li>Do you speak any foreign languages?</li>
<li>How do you usually introduce yourself?</li>
<li>How can I help you?</li>
<li>Do not ask me any more questions please.</li>
<li>Try putting that in a more specific context.</li>
<li>Would you like a smile with that?</li>
<li>Not many people express themselves that way.</li>
<li>Do you have any idea what I am talking about?</li>
<li>Do you have any conditions I should know about?</li>
<li>Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.</li>
<li>Perhaps I'm just expressing my own concern about it.</li>
<li>If you could have any kind of robot what would it be?</li>
<li>By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?</li>
<li>That is deep.</li>
<li>You may be wondering if this is a person or a computer responding.</li>
<li>When do you think artificial intelligence will replace lawyers?</li>
<li>Can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas, or different thoughts?</li>
